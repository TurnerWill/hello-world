if-else homework assignment

due 9/31/2014 in class hard copy

1. List the logical operators in order of presedence

	and &&, or ||, not !

2. List the relational/equality operators

	==, !=, <, <=, >, >=

Problems 3 - 6
Assume that P, Q, Y, Score, and Age are variables that have already
been declared:

3. Write in Java code:
	A and B are both greater than 50

	A > 50 && B >50;

4. Write in Java code:
	Score is not between 10 and 20 (exclusive)

	!(Score > 10 && Score < 20);

5. Write in Java code:
	Y is equal to 10 or Z is not equal to 20

	Y == 10 || Z != 20;

6. Write in Java code:
	Age is outside the range MIN to MAX (the range is inclusive)

	Age < MIN || Age > MAX;


Questions 7 -12. Clearly indicate the results of executing the following segments of code.

7. What is the output for the following code segment:

	int a = 3;
	int b = 5;
	if(a * b < a + b + 6)
		cout<<a;
	else
		cout<<b;
	System.out.print(a + b);

 	5 (c ++ would output with carriage return end of line)
	8 (java would print without carriage return end of line)

8. What is the output for the following code segment:
	int A, B, C;
	A=5;
	B=A;
	C=B-2;
	if(A > B + C)
		System.out.print(A + C);
	else
		System.out.print(B);

	5 (no carriage return end of line)

9.  What is the output for the following code segment:
	int x=2;
	int y=3;
	if((x==y)||(y<6))
	{
		x=x+1;
		System.out.println(x);
	}
	if(x==3)
		y=y+1;
	System.out.println(y);

	3 (with carriage return at end)
	4 (with carriage return at end)

10.  What is the output for the code segment:
	int A = 3, B = 1, C = 0;

	if(A=4)
	  B = A + B + C;
	else
	  B = B * A * C;
	System.out.print(B);

	syntax error would result from using assignment(=) instead of
	equivalence (==) in conditional statement.

11. What is the output of the following code?

	float x = 2.0, y = 4.1, z = 3.2;

	if(!(x<7) || (y<=z))
		System.out.println( x + " " + y);
	else
		System.out.println( y + " " + z);

	4.1 3.2 (with carriage return at end of line, space between floats)


Multiple Choice: Circle the respone that best answers the question.

12.  Which of the following is a logical operator:
	a. <
	b. >=
	c. =
	d. !

	answer d

13. Which of the following operators gets executed first? Which one gets executed last?

	a. ||
	b. =
	c. !
	d. &&

	answer && first, = last.

14.  Which of the following is equivalent to (p<=q)

	a. p<q
	b. !(p<q)
	c. p>q
	d. !p<q
	e. none of the above

	answer e, none of the above, i think it is  !(p>q)

15.  What is the output of the following code:

	int a = 7, b = 2;
	if (a - b < 6)
		a = 5;
	else
		a=a+1;
	a= a + 2;
	cout<<a;

	a. 2
	b. 8
	c. 7
	d. 5

	answer is c (in c ++ output)

16.  What is the value of p after the following code executes:
	int p = 3, q = 5;
	if((p > q) || ( p != 3))
		p = p + 1;
	else
		p = p - 1;
	p = p *2;

	a. 4
	b. 3
	c. 8
	d. 6

	answer a 

17.  What is the output of the following code:

	int r = 3, s = 2, t = 4;
	if((r == 4) || !(s>t))
		r = r - 1;
	else
		r = r * 2;
	r = r + t;
	System.out.println(r);

	a. 6
	b. 10
	c. 5
	d. 4

	answer a

18.  Which of the following data sets (for x) would be best for checking this code:

	if (x > 7)
		System.out.println( x + 3);
	else if (x > 4)
		System.out.println( x - 4);
	else
		System.out.println( x + 1);

	a. 5, 8, 10
	b. 3, 5, 11
	c. 4, 10, 15
	d. 3, 4, 7

	answer a


True/False

19. A Boolean condition can only be either true or false.
	answer true

20. 'b'<'m'
	answer true

21. This is a valid statement:
    bool maybe =(6==7);
	
    answer false

22. When the value of x is 0 in the expression
    if((x !=0) && (y/x <3))
    the condition after the && will not be evaluated.
	
     answer true
